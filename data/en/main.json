      "The **Smart Infrastructure Research Lab** investigates new technology to innovate traditional practices in planning, design, construction, operation, and maintenance for infrastructure such as roads, bridges, tunnels, and dams throughout their life cycles. Engineering problems mostly do not have absolute solutions, so experiential decision-making by experts considering practical constraints and environmental variables occurs frequently. The goal of SIL is to transform experiential decision-making in infrastructure life cycles into data-informed scientific decision-making by integrating various technologies such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, simulation, and economic feasibility analysis. By utilizing these technologies, SIL is exploring ways to automate and optimize manual processes in each stage of decision-making: (1) data collection, (2) data analysis, (3) future prediction, (4) alternative proposal, (5) decision and execution, (6) verification (feedback).",
