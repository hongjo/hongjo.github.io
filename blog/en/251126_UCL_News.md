      On November 26th, the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at Yonsei University hosted the <b>‘Yonsei-UCL Workshop on AI-based Smart Infrastructure & 3D Vision’</b> jointly with Professor Jan Boehm's research team from University College London (UCL) at Engineering Building 1, Room A215.
    </p>
    <p>
      This workshop was organized to share the latest research findings from both universities and foster academic exchange under the theme of converging construction engineering with artificial intelligence technology.
    </p>
    <p>
      The event was attended by Professor Jan Boehm's team from UCL, as well as researchers from the laboratories of Professors Hongjo Kim, Jongwon Ma, Honggyu Son, and Hyeongkwan Kim from Yonsei University's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, who presented their respective research topics and engaged in discussions.

      Through this meeting with the UCL research team, who are actively researching in the fields of spatial information and 3D vision, we were able to discuss the present and future of smart construction technology. We look forward to continued research exchanges between our two institutions following this workshop.
